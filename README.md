# hello-world
My first repository
I am new to programming, but am finding it a satisfying pursuit. I believe that I would like a career change to programming.


The above statement was written quite a while ago, and I actually did make the career change, and boy, was it worth it. Most of my public repo's are not particulary in-depth, though I do have Ruby on Rails project ongoing right now, but that should probably stay private for the time being.
